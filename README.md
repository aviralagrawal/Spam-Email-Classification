# Spam-Email-Classification
Spam Email Classification using Machine Learning and  Artificial Neural Networks

In this project we aply some of the most popular machine learning and Artificial Neural Network methods on the public dataset of SpamAssassin spam corpus.It was found that among the Machine Learning algorithms,KNN and Linear SVM give the best performance and that Artificial Neural Network algorithms (RNN) performs better than Machine Learning based algorithms.
