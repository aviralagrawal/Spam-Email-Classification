# Spam-Email-Classification
Spam Email Classification using Machine Learning and  Artificial Neural Networks

In this project we review some of the most popular machine
learning and Artificial Neural Network methods and their applicability
to the problem of spam e-mail classification. Descriptions of the algorithms are presented, and their performance is compared on the public dataset of SpamAssassin spam corpus and the results are finally presented.Preprocessing techniques such as Stop Word Removal,Stemming,Lemmatization, Tf-idf Vectorizer and Tokenizer have been used.The performance parameters that are used for evaluation are Accuracy, Precision, Recall and f1-score..It was found that among the Machine Learning
algorithms,KNN and Linear SVM give the best performance and that Artificial Neural Network algorithms (RNN) outperforms Machine Learning based algorithms.
